# Huffman-Algorithm
The huffman algorithm is an algorithm for the construction of Huffman codes, which consists in the creation of a binary tree based on previous information. Once this is done it is possible to express all this information on a easy way, and it will reduce the weight of the file. This sums up a compression method without loss.
